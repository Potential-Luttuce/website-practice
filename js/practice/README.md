# Plan for a Program

* Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
* What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
* Whatâ€™s the desired output?
* Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

* The last question is where you will write out an algorithm to solve the problem.
